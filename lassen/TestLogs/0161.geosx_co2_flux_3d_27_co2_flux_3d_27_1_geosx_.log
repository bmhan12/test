SolverBase compflow: currently, GEOSX assumes that there is only one mobile phase when computing the hydrostatic pressure. 
We detected multiple phases using the provided datum pressure, temperature, and component fractions. 
Please make sure that only one phase is mobile at the beginning of the simulation. 
If this is not the case, the problem will not be at equilibrium when the simulation starts
